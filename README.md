# Plane Sweep Stereo
Authors: Andrew Dunn and Ryan Parsons

Things to know:
* `requirements.txt` has all of the packages and versions to run this code
*  The input data is large, so it's not in the github repository. Go into the data directory and run download.sh to download the required datasets
* call `python3 plane_sweep_stereo.py tentacle` to execute the algorithm and generate results
* call `python3 stereo_eval.py tentacle` to run the stereo analysis algorithm
